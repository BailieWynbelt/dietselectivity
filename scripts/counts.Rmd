Load required packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in data
```{r}
ITS2 <- read_csv("../outputs/no_millet_vouchers_ITS2.csv")

trnL <- read_csv("../outputs/no_millet_vouchers_trnL.csv")
```

filter reads with a cutoff of 10
```{r}
ITS2 <- ITS2 %>% 
  filter(Reads >= 10)

trnL <- trnL %>% 
  filter(Reads >= 10)

```

Family, genra, and species counted per ITS2
```{r}
#sort high to low
counts_family_ITS2 <- ITS2 %>% 
  group_by(Family) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

counts_genus_ITS2 <- ITS2 %>% 
  group_by(Genus) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

counts_species_ITS2 <- ITS2 %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Family, genra, and species counted per trnL
```{r}
#sort high to low
counts_family_trnL <- trnL %>% 
  group_by(Family) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

counts_genus_trnL <- trnL %>% 
  group_by(Genus) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

counts_species_trnL <- trnL %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

```

Combine data frames - What was found in trnL, not found in ITS2
```{r}
count_family <- counts_family_trnL %>% 
  left_join(counts_family_ITS2,
            by = c('Family'))

count_genus <- counts_genus_trnL %>% 
  left_join(counts_genus_ITS2,
            by = c('Genus'))

count_species <- counts_species_trnL %>% 
  left_join(counts_species_ITS2,
            by = c('Species'))
```

Combine data frames - What was found in ITS2, not found in trnL
```{r}
count_family_2 <- counts_family_ITS2 %>% 
  left_join(counts_family_trnL,
            by = c('Family'))

count_genus_2 <- counts_genus_ITS2 %>% 
  left_join(counts_genus_trnL,
            by = c('Genus'))

count_species_2 <- counts_species_ITS2 %>% 
  left_join(counts_species_trnL,
            by = c('Species'))
```

See overlap in species (what doesn't overlap)
```{r}
#618 observations originally
#97 overlap - genus
overlap_genus <- count_genus %>% 
  drop_na()

#74 observations originally
#33 overlap - family
overlap_family <- count_family %>% 
  drop_na()

#111 1076 originally
#46 overlap - family
overlap_species <- count_species %>% 
  drop_na()
  
```

Graph the number of genra per species
```{r}
#count number of reads
ITS2 <- ITS2 %>%
  group_by(SampleID) %>% 
  summarise(total_reads = sum(Reads))

#count number of reads
trnL <- trnL %>% 
  group_by(SampleID) %>% 
  summarise(total_reads = sum(Reads))

#left join
joined_data <- ITS2 %>% 
  left_join(trnL, 
            by = c("SampleID"))
#rename 
joined_data <- joined_data %>% 
  rename("ITS2" = total_reads.x,
         "trnL" = total_reads.y)

#create new column
joined_data <- joined_data %>%
  group_by(SampleID) %>% 
  mutate(abundance = (trnL - ITS2))

#melt
library(reshape2)
joined_data_2 <- melt(joined_data,
                      id.vars = "SampleID",
                      variable.name = "primer",
                      value.name = "total_reads")

#remove abundance from primer column
joined_data_2 <- joined_data_2 %>% 
  filter(primer != "abundance")

#summarise
abundance_stats <- joined_data_2 %>% 
  group_by(primer) %>% 
  summarise(mean_reads = mean(total_reads, na.rm = TRUE))

#graph total reads
ggplot(data = joined_data_2, aes(x = total_reads, color = primer, fill = primer)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  geom_vline(data = abundance_stats,
             aes(xintercept = mean_reads, color = primer))

#graph abundance
