###Diet Diversity###

#Find the sum of total reads
```{r}

#Find the proportion of species 
```{r}

  group_by(SampleID) %>% 
  mutate(pI = (Reads/sum_reads_ID))

under_25_reads_trnL <- under_25_reads_trnL %>%

#Calculate the diversity index

### Create synthesized csv's ###

#Join cutoff data frames
```{r}

  rename("10_reads" = diversity_index.x,
         "25_reads" = diversity_index.y) %>% 
  select(-c(sum_reads_ID.x, pI.x, sum_reads_ID.y, pI.y))

joined_diversity <- joined_diversity %>% 
  left_join(diversity_under_50, by = "SampleID") %>% 
  rename("50_reads" = diversity_index) %>% 
  select(-c(pI, sum_reads_ID))

write_csv(joined_diversity, file = "../outputs/diversity_by_genus_trnL.csv")

```

#Join cutoff data frames 2.0
```{r}
install.packages("reshape2") 
install.packages("reshape")
library(reshape)
library(reshape2)

diversity_long <- melt(joined_diversity,
                       id.vars = "SampleID",
                       variable.name = "cutoff",
                       value.name = "diversity_index")

write_csv(diversity_long, 
          file = "../outputs/diversity_by_genus_trnL_long.csv")
```

### Visualize/understand ###

#Read_csv
```{r}
diversity <- read_csv("../outputs/diversity_by_genus_trnL.csv")

```
#Look at differences in cut-offs
```{r}

  summarise(mean_diversity = mean(diversity_index, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_diversity = sd(diversity_index, na.rm = TRUE))

```

#Look at ggplot
```{r}
ggplot(data = diversity_long, aes(x = diversity_index, color = cutoff, fill = cutoff)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5)

```

#Run stats - is there a statistical differenece
```{r}
#what is the best to run??
diversity_anova <- aov(diversity_index ~ cutoff, data = diversity_long)
summary(diversity_anova)
